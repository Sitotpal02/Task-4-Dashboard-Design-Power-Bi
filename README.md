# ðŸ“Š Sales Performance Dashboard â€“ README

## Project Overview
This project evaluates **sales performance across customers, products, and states** using Excel dashboards.  
The goal is to provide a **single view of sales, profit, and customer contribution** to help identify which areas drive growth and which require improvement.

## Business Problem
While overall revenue was steady, the company faced challenges in:
- Detecting **unprofitable products** due to discounts/cost inefficiencies  
- Highlighting **regional disparities** in sales and profits  
- Assessing **customer concentration risks**  
- Comparing **profitability across categories** (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology)  
- Identifying **seasonal sales trends** for forecasting  

---

## Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Removed duplicates and null values  
   - Standardized date formats and text casing  
   - Created calculated fields (e.g., Profit Margin, YoY Growth)  

2. **Dashboard Development (Excel)**  
   - KPIs: Total Sales, Profit Margin, Top Customers, Regional Sales  
   - Visuals: Line charts (trend), bar charts (states/products), pie charts (categories), tables (top customers)  

3. **Analysis & Insights**  
   - Phones & Chairs led revenue (~330K each)  
   - Some products (Storage, Binders) showed low/negative profit margins  
   - California dominated sales (457K+), while some states had <1K sales  
   - Top 5 customers contributed major profit â†’ concentration risk  
   - Customer base grew from ~600 (2014) to 700+ (2017)  
   - Sales peaked in Q4 (Octâ€“Dec, 350Kâ€“400K)  

---

## Final Recommendations
- Adjust **pricing/discounts** for low-margin products  
- Expand into **underperforming states**  
- Diversify **customer portfolio** beyond top 5 clients  
- Focus on **high-margin categories** (Technology, Office Supplies)  
- Use **seasonality insights** for better demand forecasting
